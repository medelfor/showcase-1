# Getting started

![Surreal Docs Cloud logo](images/gettingstarted_icon.png)

Welcome to a documentation showcasing capabilities of Surreal Docs™ and Surreal Docs™ Cloud. It is generated by Surreal Docs from a sample Unreal Engine project and hosted by Surreal Docs Cloud. The featured sample project provides an implementation of an in-game jetpack and its related entities.

title: Source Code
The sources this documentation was generated from are available on GitHub via [this link](https://github.com/medelfor/showcase-1 "Showcase source code").
``

Documentation generated by Surreal Docs generally consists of three parts:
- [C++ API Reference](api/cpp "C++ API Reference") which is generated from header files, taking into account all Unreal Engine specific features, e.g. reflection macros;
- [Blueprint API Reference](api/blueprint "C++ Blueprint Reference") which is generated from reflection data and shows every Blueprint-exposed entity in the same way it's available to a Blueprint user;
- And finally, Surreal Docs merges the documentation with custom pages that are written by the user in a feature-rich dialect of Markdown. These pages can serve as guides or how-tos for your project or, for example, a "Getting started" page just like this one.

Notice the version switcher provided by Surreal Docs Cloud on the header of every page throughout the documentation. You can use it to easily switch to a documentation for a different version of the project.

## Don't know where to start?

Feel to free to check out any page presented, but if you feel overwhelmed, here are some highlights for you:
- [Here](api/cpp/Jetpack "The Jetpack module") you can find Jetpack, which is the main C++ module;
- Check out [AJetpack](api/cpp/Jetpack/AJetpack "AJetpack class") - the central class of that module;
- Take a look at [Blueprint-exposed entities](api/blueprint/Jetpack "Blueprint representation of Jetpack module") of the Jetpack module;
- And [Blueprint entities](api/blueprint/%3CContent%3E "The content-defined entities") defined directly via Unreal Editor.
